## Features
[] create sounds on tick
[] create a grand central svg and move the arms (ambitious)
[] create a train on figma that moves
[] DONT RUN ANIMATION ON FIRST RENDER. This is because when there's too many animations running at once it lags.


## Bugs
[] Resizing browser triggers all animation
[] Make mobile have an overscroll property. I think you can set the row to be a max width, even if the length is long.
